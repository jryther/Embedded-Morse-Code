# Embedded-Morse-Code

Overview:

In this lab, you will use TI Code Composer Studio (CCS) to program the TC CC3220x LAUNCHXL to send a Morse code message via the LED using a synchronous state machine. This work will build on the concepts you learned during your activities in the zyBook this week.

During this milestone, you will use CCS to edit, compile, and load code into the CC32xx board. You will then proceed to use it for debugging. Throughout this process, you explore the components of a CCS project and the CCS code generator (system config). You will also be able to learn more about the timer and interrupt drivers.

Goal: Your objective is to blink the green, yellow, and red LEDs in the lower right corner of the board (the corner opposite the USB connector). Design a synchronous state machine that creates a pattern of blinking lights from the LEDs. This pattern should contain a message in Morse code. When a button is pressed, the Morse code message of the blinking LEDs should change.
